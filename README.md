# 🐧 Linux

## Download

Clone the Linux branch directly into your Isaac `mods` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alxay/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-discord-rich-presence.git
```

Clone it into:

```text
/home/[YOUR USERNAME]/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/common/The Binding of Isaac Rebirth/mods
```

Replace `[YOUR USERNAME]` with your actual username.

## Installation

Create a Python virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd "/home/[YOUR USERNAME]/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/common/The Binding of Isaac Rebirth/mods/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-discord-rich-presence"

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Steam Launch Options (Required)

Open:

```text
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth → Properties → Launch Options
```

Paste:

```text
"$STEAM_COMPAT_INSTALL_PATH/mods/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-discord-rich-presence/launcher.sh" && %command%
```

### For Repentogon

If you are using Repentogon, use this launch option instead:

```text
"$STEAM_COMPAT_INSTALL_PATH/mods/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-discord-rich-presence/launcherREPENTOGON.sh" %command%
```


### Important

- Keep the quotes around the full path.
- Keep `%command%` exactly as shown.
- Replace `[YOUR USERNAME]` with your actual username.
- Make sure you have created the Python virtual environment before launching the game.

### Requirements

- Python 3
- The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth
- Discord desktop app running

---

## How It Works

1. The Lua part of the mod collects run data in-game.
2. The launcher starts the Python integration.
3. Discord Rich Presence is updated while you play.

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Rich Presence visible
- Re-check your Steam Launch Options and path spelling.
- Make sure the mod is enabled in the in-game Mods menu.
- Make sure the Discord **desktop** app is running (browser version is not supported).
- Open the debug console (`~`) and check for any errors.
- Check the game log for any `[discordrichpresence]` entries or error messages.
  - **Windows:** `Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Repentance+\log.txt`
  - Search for `discordrichpresence` using `Ctrl + F`.
  - If there are no matching entries, the mod is most likely not being loaded.
- If you play without Repentance, you may need to modify `main.lua` (remove the `player:GetRotterHearts()` call because that function does not exist in Afterbirth and will cause a crash).

### Windows
- Verify the launcher path.
- If Steam is installed on another drive, update the drive letter.

### Linux
- Verify you replaced `[YOUR USERNAME]` with your username.
- Make sure the Python virtual environment has been created.
- Run `./launcher.sh` from the mod directory to check for errors.

### Mod not loading

- Verify the mod folder is located inside the game's `mods` directory.
